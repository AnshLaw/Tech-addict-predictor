Technology Prediction ML Project
Overview:
This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict future trends in technology adoption. Leveraging a dataset collected from over 250 surveyed users, the system analyzes various factors such as demographics, preferences, and past behavior to forecast emerging technologies likely to gain traction in the market.

Key Features:
Data Collection: Gathered data from a diverse set of users through surveys and structured interviews.
Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis, handling missing values and outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted comprehensive exploratory analysis to uncover patterns and correlations within the data.
Feature Engineering: Extracted relevant features and engineered new ones to enhance model performance.
Model Selection: Implemented various machine learning algorithms including regression, classification, and clustering to predict technology trends.
Model Evaluation: Evaluated model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Deployed the best-performing model to make real-time predictions accessible via a web interface or API.

Technologies Used:
Python: Core programming language for data analysis, modeling, and deployment.
Scikit-learn: Utilized for machine learning algorithms and model evaluation.
Pandas, NumPy: Data manipulation and numerical computation libraries.
Matplotlib, Seaborn: Data visualization for exploratory analysis and result presentation.
Flask/Django: Web framework for deploying the predictive model.
GitHub Actions: Automated workflows for testing and deployment.
